EasyPR is an open source Chinese license plate recognition system. The goal of EasyPR is to become a simple, efficient and accurate license plate identification library. EasyPR based on openCV open source library, you can transplant to all the platforms that opencv support. The repository of EasyPR is https://github.com/liuruoze/EasyPR, which is an excellent example of learning openCV. Thanks very much for the team of EasyPR!

### EasyPR_MFC
EasyPR comes with the demo based on win32 console, the picture to be recognized is specified in the program, you must modify the program to change the picture. In order to study EasyPR and openCV, I created the EasyPR_MFC, which functions as follow:
# Single Test:  test one picture at a time
* The picture to be recognized could be specified by a button;
* The source picture and the identified result could show on the interface;
* The license plate recognition process and the middle process can be displayed in the top-left of source picture.

* The folder to be recognized could be specified by a button;
* The file name and recognise result, the time of plate detect, get plate color and char recognise could be show in a list.
